		<h1>How to make a playit.gg server for H3MP</h1>
		<p>A guide by TrafficCone</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>PRELUDE</h2>
		<p>So, you may be asking yourself, why would you want to host with playit.gg in the first place? Well, using the service will allow you to play H3MP;
		<ul>
			<li>Without port forwarding</li>
			<li>Without revealing your IP address to others</li>
			<li>With a better connection</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you want to learn more, you can go to their very own website <a href="https://playit.gg/">here</a>. Well, without any more delay, let's learn how you can get this started!</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>CONFIGURING YOUR MOD SETTINGS</h2>
		<p>First, get your Local IP Address*, which you can usually find by using the command "ipconfig"</p>

		<p>Next, you'll want to go to your H3MP configuration file, which you can find where the mod is installed, and insert your local IP Address into the IP field. The rest of the settings are your preference, but make sure to remember the Port.</p>

		<p>Great! Now that we have the mod set up for playit.gg, we can now set up playit.gg itself!</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>SETTING UP YOUR PLAYIT.GG TUNNEL</h2>
		<p>To use playit.gg, you'll first have to download their client <a href="https://playit.gg/download">here</a>. After you launch the program, you should be led to a webpage telling you to sign up. You can sign up or continue as a guest. It's up to you. </p>
		<img src="guideContents\img3.png" height=512em>
		<p>After you log in, you will be granted access to your dashboard. You should see a screen like this:</p>
		<img src="guideContents\img4.png" height=512em>
		<p>You'll want to click on the "Add Tunnel" button, and choose Custom in the drop-down menu. Set the "Local Ipv4" to your Local IP Address we got earlier, and your "Local Port" to whatever you set the port you as in your H3MP configuration file earlier. </p>
		<img src="guideContents\img5.png" height=512em>
		<p>When it asks you for the "Port Type", set it as TCP+UDP, and the Port Count to 1. Then, click Create Tunnel. </p>
		<img src="guideContents\img6.png" height=512em>
		<p>The tunnel can be named whatever you please. The important thing is that you are essentially done. Hooray! </p>
		<hr>
		<h2>HOSTING A SERVER WITH YOUR PLAYIT.GG TUNNEL</h2>
		<p>Before starting your game, start the playit.gg program that you got earlier, and wait until it is done. Next, you'll want to start your game, look at the wrist menu, and click H3MP -> Host. </p>
		<img src="guideContents\img7.png" height=512em>
		<p>Now for the best part, inviting friends (or strangers). Go back to your dashboard, and look at the Tunnel Details. Here, you will see what you need to send to your friends. The "IPv4" is the IP Address, and the Port is, well, the Port. Tell other people to connect to that information. </p>

		<p>Congratulations, you have officially hosted an H3MP server through playit.gg! I hope you enjoy your experience, and thank you for reading this guide! </p>

		<h2>ABOUT THAT ASTERISK</h2>
		<p>Your Local IP Address may change depending on how your router and/or computer is configured. To remedy this, you have two options:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check and change your Local IP Address regularly in playit.gg</li>
			<li>Set up a Static IP Address</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Teaching you how to set up a Static IP address is a complicated thing, and you'd be better off searching for a solution on the World Wide Web. I wish you luck! </p>
